Section JReadme
The project is a 2D fighting game. To control the game, only keyboard is required.
In order to run the project, the only thing any user needs other than the standard python is the pyaudio library. In order to install the pyaudio module, follow the instructions on the following webpage: https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/

The music module does not work because the music file is not included in the file submitted through the autolab due to the size limitation. To fix that, simply put the music folder under the term project folder.

In order to launch the multiplayer system, the user has to launch the server.py file using the terminal first. The default setting of the host is local for the purpose of demonstration. If the user wants to play with a player on another laptop, changes have to be made on the host and port setting. If the server is not set up properly, the program will refuse to enter the “multiplayer” mode.
